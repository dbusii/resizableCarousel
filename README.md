# resizableCarousel
This is a really lightweight javascript carousel I've designed. I've used Travis Clarke's Image-map function to calculate the map coordinates upon resize. The images for the carousel are stored within an array and are looped through either forward or backwards depending on whether you clicked on the left or right of the image.
